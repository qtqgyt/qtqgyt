- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Some pointless projects and organizing my hard drive...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Python and starting in more things like Javascript and Go.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Nothing (Right now)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Nothing (Right now)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Whatever you want!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Email me](mailto:qtqgyt@qtqgyt.net)
